What I do girl, I did for you
Couldn't see him loving you like I do
What I do girl, I did for you
Couldn't see him loving you like I do

What if flowers came in black and white
Would you still call to me
If I was growing like a tiny seed
Would you still water me

Lovers, lovers weekend on the beach
Used to be us holding hands
But now I love to freeze

Ya'll, two making one
Watching the sun go down under the sheets
Me, you're killing, sick in the rain
Tears froze yesterday, I can't frame
Ya'll, the picture of what I see
You're touching him not touching me, whatever

What I do girl, I did for you
Couldn't see him loving you like I do
What I do girl, I did for you
Couldn't see him loving you like I do, now

What if flowers came in black and white
Would you still call to me
If I was growing like a tiny seed
Would you still water me

Uh, the door was unlocked
I walked in the house and the door I lock
Sand, sand everywhere
Clothes on the stairs, the moment I feared
What I could hear
Blazed my heart and cursed my ear
I stood in the doorway
When was the last time we kissed that way
I moved so fast, there was no time to defend my blast
Before we hit the floor
All I heard was calling "don't hit him no more"

What I do girl, I did for you
Couldn't see him loving you like I do
What I do girl, I did for you
Couldn't see him loving you like I do, now

Stay with me, don't disappear

What if flowers came in black and white
Would you still call to me
If I was growing like a tiny seed
Would you still water me

What I do girl, I did for you
Couldn't see him loving you like I do
What I do girl, I did for you
Couldn't see him loving you like I do, uh

Dance with me like we did last year
Stay with me, don't disappear

Dance with me like we did last year
Stay with me, don't disappear

Dance with me like we did last year
Stay with me, don't disappear

Dance with me like we did last year
Stay with me, don't disappear
